A refreshing blend of simplicity and sophistication, ready for your finest ideas. Tea is a theme for GitHub pagesâ€”or any page, really. If you'd like to use this for GitHub Pages, just <a href="https://github.com/house/tea/fork">fork this project</a> and replace my content with your own lovely thoughts and ideas.

You can use Tea for other web things, too. Modify it in any way that suits your purpose! This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).
